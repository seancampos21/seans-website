    <h2>The Encounter</h2>
    <p>It was just another day hiking deep in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The sun was low, filtering through the redwoods like golden smoke. The forest was quiet — not eerie, just still in that way nature sometimes gets when it’s holding its breath.</p>
    <p>That’s when I saw it.</p>
    <p>A mountain lion. Not in the distance, not through binoculars — but there, maybe 30 feet away, standing stone-still on the trail ahead. It wasn’t crouched or aggressive. Just watching. Like it had been there the whole time, waiting for <em>me</em> to notice <em>it</em>.</p>
    <p>I froze. My breath got shallow. Every instinct in me screamed to run, but something deeper — maybe ancient — told me to stay still. Don’t look it in the eye. Don’t turn your back.</p>
    <p>For what felt like a minute, we just existed there — two animals in the forest. It eventually turned, padded silently into the trees, and disappeared as if it had never been there.</p>

    <h2>What It Taught Me</h2>
    <p>People talk about being humbled by nature, but this was different. I didn’t feel small — I felt <strong>real</strong>. Awake. The kind of moment that burns itself into your brain and changes your wiring.</p>
    <p>Since that day, the wilderness hasn’t just been scenic. It’s <em>alive</em> — and it watches back.</p>
