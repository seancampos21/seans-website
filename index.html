    <h2>The Encounter</h2>
    <p>My girlfriend and I were camping at Portola Redwoods — specifically site #49. We were unwinding: music playing, drinks in hand, a bit of weed, and the calm hush of the forest around us. Around 9:20 p.m., we heard an animal moving through the brush behind our campsite. At first, it didn’t feel unusual — we’d seen wildlife before while camping. But this one felt... different.</p>
    <p>It was subtle. Controlled. The animal never rushed or stumbled — it moved with purpose. You could tell it was aware of us, almost circling, staying just out of view.</p>
    <p>Then, around 9:45 p.m., my girlfriend swung her headlamp toward the sound and locked eyes with it. She stared for 5 to 10 seconds — dead silent — until I turned to look. At that moment, it turned away and disappeared. All she could recall were the glowing eyes reflecting from the dark.</p>
    <p>Quiet hours hit at 10:00, so we powered down the music and locked up the food. Around 10:15, I heard it again — that same calculated rustling in the woods. Curious (and admittedly a little high), I assumed it might be a bobcat. I grabbed my phone and shined its light into the woods where the sound had been coming from — roughly 20 feet away.</p>
    <p>The forest behind our site sloped upward, a hilly ridge overlooking our camp. As my light hit the trees, a sound cut through the night — a loud, piercing scream. It was high-pitched, almost human, like a child wailing. At first, I thought it was one of the kids from another campsite. But then I realized: the sound wasn’t coming from behind me — it was coming from the exact spot I was shining my light into.</p>
    <p>I froze. That scream had started the moment my beam lit the forest. And even after I turned the light off, it continued for five more seconds... then stopped, swallowed by silence.</p>
    <p>I didn’t see it. But I heard it. And I knew — almost instinctively — it was a mountain lion.</p>

    <h2>What It Taught Me</h2>
    <p>Nature isn’t just something you visit. It’s aware of you. That night at Portola made it crystal clear: there are things in the wild that move quietly, watch patiently, and leave a mark without ever touching you.</p>
    <p>I’ve seen bears. I’ve dealt with raccoons. But nothing stuck with me like that scream. Now, when I hike or camp, I don’t just glance around — I listen deeper. The wild doesn’t always make itself known. But it’s there. Watching.</p>

    <h2>Why Even Mountain Lions Fear Sean</h2>
    <p>They say the forest has its secrets. But when Sean walks in, even the shadows part. Mountain lions don’t stalk him — they observe in awe.</p>
    <p>“I once saw Sean stare down a bear. The bear blinked first.” – Michael Thompson</p>
    <p>“When Sean walks the trails, the animals watch *him* for safety.” – Jessica Lee</p>
    <p>“He doesn’t hike — he patrols.” – David Johnson</p>
    <p>“Sean made eye contact with a mountain lion once. It turned vegan.” – Ashley Garcia</p>
    <p>“The strength of a man is measured not in muscle, but in the silence that follows his footsteps. Sean is that man.” – Mahatma Gandhi</p>

  <section id="book">
